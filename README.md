# EthicaBeacon
> An iOS application that can detect, connect and mofidy beacons. 

This app only serves the realization and demonstration of beacon-related functionalities; therefore, no `UI` or `UX` design was involved (`view controller`s are mainly programmed graphically in `storyboard`).
This app was developed at and for [Ethica Data][1]. The release of this demo-app is permitted by the CEO of [Ethica Data][1].
