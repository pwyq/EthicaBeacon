# EthicaBeacon
> An iOS application that can detect, connect and mofidy beacons. 

This app only serves the realization and demonstration of beacon-related functionalities; therefore, no major `UI` or `UX` design was involved (`view controller`s are mainly programmed graphically in `storyboard`).

This app was developed at and for [Ethica Data][1]. The release of this demo-app is permitted by the CEO of [Ethica Data][1].

## Notes

- Due to the limit size of upload-able files, [EstimoteSDK][2] and [KontaktSDK][3] are not included in this repository.

- The files in `ED_TEST` was well-organized in ordered `group`s in `Xcode`; however, the files lost organizations as they moved to my own laptop. Sorry :(

- This app is only worked for those devices that equipped `BLE` (Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth 4.0+)

- This app is my first project with iOS+Swift+Xcode+Mac, meaning that there must exist a lot of naive code designs. If you think somewhere of the code need to be improved, feel free to `pull request`. Thank you ^_^
